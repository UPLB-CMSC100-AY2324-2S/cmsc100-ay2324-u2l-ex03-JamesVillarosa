Steps on how I created my Exer 03:
1. I first initialized the hardcoded Passwords and Username.
2. I created the validatePassword function which includes:
    * Initialization of variables need in validation.
    * Checking if 2 passwords are match.
    * Checking every chars in password if there is
    a string, number, uppercase, and lowercase.
    * Checking the condition mention in exercise using the updated value of variables.
3. I implemented condition that checks if password is valid.
4. I created reversePassword function which includes:
    * Initializing empty array for the reverse chars to be stored in.
    * Traversing and Pushing chars in array.
    * Concatenating every element in array making it a string.
    * Returning created reversed password.
5. I created objectPassword function that creates object with username, actual password, and new password keys.

Key Takeaways:
1. Familiaring JavaScript syntax.
2. Familiarization in Data Type, Loops, Array, Condition Statements, Variables, and Objects.
3. Algorithm creation in JavaScript.
